# Image Color Picker

## Description

The Image Color Picker provides a tool for selecting colors from images. You can visit the [website](https://dmitry-seredkin.github.io/image-color-picker/) to try out this tool without requiring any setup or installation.

## Scripts

`yarn start` &mdash; runs the app in the development mode (open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser).

`yarn build` &mdash; builds the app for production to the build folder.

## User Guide

To start working with the Image Color Picker, you need to **copy an image** from another source or application and then **paste it** directly into the Image Color Picker.

Currently, the Image Color Picker supports two modes: the **default mode** and the **dropper mode**. You can switch between these modes to access different functionalities.

### Default Mode

In the default mode, you can click and drag the image to change its position on the screen. This allows you to view different parts of the image more easily.

You can also zoom in or out on the image to get a closer or wider view. Use the mouse wheel to adjust the zoom level according to your preference.

### Dropper Mode

*To activate the dropper mode, click on the dropper button located in the application's header.*

In the dropper mode, you will see a dropper lens on the image. You can move this dropper lens around the image to examine different points and view the colors present in those areas.

When the dropper lens is positioned over a specific point on the image, you can click on that point to choose the color. The selected color will be displayed, allowing you to note or use it for your desired purposes.

**Note:** In the dropper mode, you can use the arrow keys for more precise navigation of the dropper lens.
